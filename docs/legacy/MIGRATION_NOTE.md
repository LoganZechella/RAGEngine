# Documentation Migration Note

**Date:** $(date)
**Migration:** Unified all documentation into single comprehensive README.md

## What Was Done

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Thoroughly analyzed the actual codebase on the BDx-Fork branch to understand the true implementation versus what was documented.

2. **Major Discrepancies Found**:
   - System is specialized for "Breath Diagnostics" medical applications
   - Multi-collection architecture with 7 specialized collections
   - Advanced content filtering system for medical/regulatory content
   - Full web interface with collection management
   - Enhanced data models and synthesis capabilities

3. **Documentation Unified**: Combined information from:
   - `README.md` (main README - had generic RAG info)
   - `README-DISTRIBUTION.md` (distribution guide with breath diagnostics branding)
   - `DOCKER.md` (Docker deployment guide)

4. **New Unified README.md Features**:
   - Accurate "Breath Diagnostics RAGEngine" branding
   - Complete multi-collection architecture documentation
   - Content filtering and document type detection
   - Both web interface and Python API documentation
   - Comprehensive Docker deployment instructions
   - All advanced features actually present in the codebase

## Legacy Files Preserved Here

- `README-DISTRIBUTION.md` - Original distribution guide
- `DOCKER.md` - Original Docker documentation

## Result

The root `README.md` now accurately reflects the actual codebase implementation and provides comprehensive documentation for all features. No information was lost - everything was incorporated into the unified documentation.

The new README accurately represents the sophisticated breath diagnostics knowledge base system rather than presenting it as a generic RAG engine.
